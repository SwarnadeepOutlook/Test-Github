I wrote a poem
Fine, sunny day outside.
Its a temporary me beside
Listening to music
Feels more artistic
Very poor english capability
Dont know how to increase the versity.
Learning github
Wish i could be in a bathtub
Totally abstract
Still better than a mundane monotonus life.
Learning something new of my own
Takes pride on the learning
increase the innovation hormone in the brain.
Meditation should help, trying to be regular.
Changes in the file
Hope to have a positive change in life.
Adding a line after making a change in forked file.
